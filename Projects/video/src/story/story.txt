I failed to participate in a psychological experiment once...
So a few years ago, I (21f) found a call for experiment participants at the University of Utah. Participants were offered $40 for participation in a psych experiment testing behavior. On the day of the experiment I was instructed to go to the university and to steal a debit card from the backpack of a specific professor. I was told that the professor was knowledgable about the experiment, but I had to "steal" the card without getting caught. Diligently, I waited for the professor to leave their office and snuck in. I saw the backpack on the ground, but the wallet was sitting on the professor's desk so I opened it, took the debit card, and brought it to the place I was instructed to bring it. An undergradute student was waiting for me, but didn't take the card. He just asked me if I took it then sat me down to do an assessment on a computer. About a third of the way through the assessment I heard his phone ding with a message notification. He let out a gasp, and rushed over to me to stop the assessment. He asked me if I took the wallet from the backpack like I was instructed and I told him I grabbed the wallet on the desk. He then asked me to show him the card and as soon as he saw it he whipped out $40 bucks and told me to leave because I had stolen the professor's *actual* debit card and could no longer particpate in the experiment. I am still confused to this day if it was a strange psych experiment that I completed or if I actually almost took that poor professor's card.

# Basic Web Development Project

This repository contains the foundational files for a simple web development project, including HTML and CSS. These files demonstrate the fundamental structure and style elements used in web design.

## Project Structure

- `Mon_Site.html` - This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage. It includes basic elements such as headers, paragraphs, and image placeholders.
- `Mon_Site_2.html` - An additional HTML file that might represent another page of the website, such as a contact page or about section.
- `style.css` - The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file that defines the visual appearance of the HTML files. It sets the color, size, layout, and other visual elements of the webpage.

## Styling Overview

The `style.css` file contains several styling rules:

- `h1` elements are styled to appear in red.
- The `body` of the document has a blue background color.
- The `#carte`, `#carte2`, and `#carte3` ID selectors target specific elements for styling, controlling width, margin, background color, and text alignment.
- Unordered list (`ul`) items use square bullets as defined by the `list-style-type` property.

## Running the Project

To view the project:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Mon_Site.html` or `Mon_Site_2.html` files in a web browser to display the web pages.
3. The `style.css` file should be in the same directory as the HTML files to ensure the styles are applied correctly.

Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS files to experiment with different layouts and styles.

# Snake Game

Welcome to the classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the `pygame` library. Navigate the snake to eat the food and grow while avoiding running into the walls or itself.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake:
- **Up Arrow Key**: Move Up
- **Down Arrow Key**: Move Down
- **Left Arrow Key**: Move Left
- **Right Arrow Key**: Move Right

Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows in length and your score increases. The game ends if you run into the walls or the snake's body.

## Features

- Smooth snake movement on a grid-based level

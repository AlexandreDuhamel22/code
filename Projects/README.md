## Project Overviews

### Connexe Graphs
- **Language**: Python  
- **Description**: An algorithm that identifies and counts connected components in graphs.

### JPEG2PPM
- **Language**: C  
- **Description**: A comprehensive project that decodes JPEG images to PPM format, delving into image processing and compression techniques.

### Language Theory Calculator
- **Language**: Python  
- **Description**: A calculator that evaluates expressions in infix and Polish notations, implementing a parser and token management.

### Numerical Modeling
- **Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Description**: A Jupyter notebook dedicated to the approximation of non-linear string differential equations in numerical modeling.

### Probabilities
- **Language**: Markdown (Documentation/Explanation)  
- **Description**: Two markdown documents exploring various probability problems and their solutions.

### Monte Carlo
- **Language**: Python  
- **Description**: A simulation project that uses the Monte Carlo method to approximate the value of Ï€ (pi) and provides a visual representation in the form of a GIF.

### Statistics
- **Language**: R (R Markdown)  
- **Description**: A statistical analysis conducted on earthquake data sets, processed and visualized using R.

### VHDL_RiscvV
- **Language**: VHDL  
- **Description**: Implementation of the classic game Space Invaders on an FPGA using VHDL, showcasing skills in digital design and computer architecture.

### Object-Oriented Java Simulation Project
- **Language**: Java  
- **Description**: Developed a dynamic simulation suite featuring animated balls with customizable velocities and deceleration mechanics. Implemented various cellular automata including the Schelling Simulator and multiple versions of the Game of Life. Additionally, created intricate boids systems showcasing group behaviors and interactions.

### Spinning Cube
- **Language**: C  
- **Description**: A fun terminal-based animation of a spinning cube rendered using C, demonstrating basic 3D rotation and ASCII graphics.

### Video
- **Language**: Python  
- **Description**: A partial video editor that fetches Reddit stories, uses the ElevenLabs API for voiceover, and merges audio with video. Currently exploring TikTok auto-upload via Selenium, though UI changes have caused some issues.

### AI / Number
- **Language**: Python  
- **Description**: A machine learning project for handwritten number recognition based on a small dataset found online. You can input an image or draw a number live. It performs well but shows limitations due to the dataset's uniformity; a better dataset or adjustment of the ML/softmax output could improve accuracy.
